# Hotel Reservations

In this project, I analyze hotel booking data between the years 2018â€“2020 acquired from Absent Data to figure out the revenue breakdown for several kinds of hotel characteristics. The data is analyzed in SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, and simultaneously in Google's BigQuery) and visualized in Power BI via an interactive dashboard.

The revenue data was split between several sheets in an Excel Workbook that had to be imported to Microsoft SQL Server, appended and summarized. Further on, indicators such as yearly revenue, yearly revenue by hotel type and the latter's percentage in the yearly revenue were created. The data is then broken down by hotel type, year, and market segment. Below you can see a snapshot of the data along with the SQL code.
